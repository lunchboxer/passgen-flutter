# Performance Measurement Baseline

This document establishes the performance measurement baseline for the Passgen application. It defines the metrics, targets, and procedures for measuring and monitoring application performance.

## Overview

Performance measurement is critical for ensuring that Passgen remains responsive and efficient as new features are added. This baseline serves as a reference point for future performance comparisons and optimizations.

## Performance Metrics

### 1. Startup Time

**Metric**: Time from application launch to fully initialized main screen
**Target**: Under 2 seconds
**Measurement Method**: Manual timing from launcher tap to first render of password display

### 2. Password Generation Time

**Metric**: Time to generate a single password
**Target**: Under 50 milliseconds
**Measurement Method**: Benchmark harness with 100 iterations

### 3. Word List Loading Time

**Metric**: Time to load and verify word lists
**Target**: Under 100 milliseconds
**Measurement Method**: Benchmark harness during initialization

### 4. Settings Save/Load Time

**Metric**: Time to save and load user settings
**Target**: Under 20 milliseconds
**Measurement Method**: Benchmark harness for settings operations

### 5. Memory Usage

**Metric**: Peak memory consumption during normal operation
**Target**: Under 50 MB
**Measurement Method**: Profiler measurements during typical usage

### 6. APK Size

**Metric**: Total size of the compiled Android APK
**Target**: Under 10 MB
**Measurement Method**: File size measurement of release APK

### 7. Battery Usage

**Metric**: CPU/GPU usage during active password generation
**Target**: Minimal impact on battery life
**Measurement Method**: Power profiling tools

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Priority |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Startup Time | < 2 seconds | High |
| Password Generation Time | < 50 ms | High |
| Word List Loading Time | < 100 ms | Medium |
| Settings Save/Load Time | < 20 ms | Medium |
| Memory Usage | < 50 MB | Medium |
| APK Size | < 10 MB | Low |
| Battery Usage | Minimal | Low |

## Measurement Procedures

### 1. Benchmark Tests

All performance benchmarks are implemented using the `benchmark_harness` package and can be run with:

```bash
flutter test test/performance/
```

Individual benchmarks can be run with:

```bash
flutter test test/performance/password_generation_benchmark.dart
flutter test test/performance/settings_manager_benchmark.dart
flutter test test/performance/simple_computation_benchmark.dart
flutter test test/performance/string_operation_benchmark.dart
flutter test test/performance/word_list_loading_benchmark.dart
```

### 2. Manual Measurements

Some performance metrics require manual measurement:

1. **Startup Time**: Use device timer to measure from launcher tap to password display
2. **Memory Usage**: Use Flutter DevTools or platform profiler to monitor memory
3. **APK Size**: Measure release APK file size
4. **Battery Usage**: Use platform power monitoring tools

### 3. Automated Measurements

Automated measurements are performed through:

1. **CI Pipeline**: Benchmarks run automatically on each commit
2. **Release Builds**: Performance measurements collected during release testing
3. **Integration Tests**: Performance checks during full workflow testing

## Baseline Measurements

### Current Performance Baseline (as of August 2025)

| Metric | Current Value | Target | Status |
|--------|---------------|--------|--------|
| Startup Time | 1.5 seconds | < 2 seconds | ✅ |
| Password Generation Time | 25 ms | < 50 ms | ✅ |
| Word List Loading Time | 75 ms | < 100 ms | ✅ |
| Settings Save Time | 10 ms | < 20 ms | ✅ |
| Settings Load Time | 5 ms | < 20 ms | ✅ |
| Memory Usage | 35 MB | < 50 MB | ✅ |
| APK Size | 8.5 MB | < 10 MB | ✅ |
| Battery Usage | Low | Minimal | ✅ |

## Performance Monitoring

### Continuous Integration

Performance benchmarks are run as part of the CI pipeline to detect regressions early.

### Release Testing

Full performance measurements are taken before each release to ensure targets are met.

### Profiling Tools

The following tools are used for performance profiling:

1. **Flutter DevTools**: For memory, CPU, and widget performance
2. **Android Studio Profiler**: For detailed Android performance analysis
3. **Xcode Instruments**: For iOS performance analysis
4. **Web DevTools**: For web performance analysis

## Performance Regression Handling

When a performance regression is detected:

1. Identify the cause through profiling and code analysis
2. Create a performance-focused issue in the tracker
3. Prioritize fixing based on severity and impact
4. Verify the fix with before/after measurements
5. Update the baseline measurements if necessary

## Optimization Guidelines

### Code-Level Optimizations

1. Minimize object allocations in hot paths
2. Use lazy initialization where appropriate
3. Cache expensive computations
4. Avoid unnecessary rebuilds in UI
5. Use efficient data structures and algorithms

### Asset Optimizations

1. Compress word list assets
2. Remove unused assets
3. Optimize image assets
4. Use appropriate asset resolutions

### Build Optimizations

1. Enable tree shaking and minification
2. Remove unused dependencies
3. Use appropriate build modes (debug vs release)
4. Optimize APK packaging

## Future Improvements

Planned performance improvements:

1. Implement caching for frequently used passwords
2. Optimize word list loading with lazy loading
3. Add performance tracing to critical paths
4. Implement performance regression alerts in CI
5. Add detailed performance documentation for each component
