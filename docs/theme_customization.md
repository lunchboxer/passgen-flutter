# Theme Customization

Passgen offers three distinct theme options to personalize your password generation experience:

## Available Themes

1. **Light Theme**: A clean, bright interface with light backgrounds and dark text
2. **Dark Theme**: A comfortable dark interface with dark backgrounds and light text
3. **Black Theme**: A pure black interface designed to reduce battery consumption on OLED screens

## How to Change Themes

1. Open the Passgen application
2. Tap on the settings icon (gear) in the top-right corner
3. In the settings screen, locate the "Theme" section
4. Select your preferred theme from the dropdown menu:
   - Light
   - Dark
   - Black
5. The theme will be applied immediately and will persist across app sessions

## Theme Persistence

Your theme preference is automatically saved and will be applied each time you open the application. The theme setting is stored locally on your device and is not shared with any external services.

## System Theme Integration

Currently, Passgen does not automatically switch themes based on your system settings. You need to manually select your preferred theme in the settings screen.
