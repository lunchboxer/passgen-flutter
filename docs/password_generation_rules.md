# Password Generation Rules

This document explains how Passgen generates passwords and the rules that govern the process.

## Overview

Passgen generates passwords using a word-based approach that creates strong, memorable passwords. Instead of using completely random characters, Passgen combines random words from a carefully curated dictionary with optional enhancements like capitalization, separators, numbers, and symbols.

## Password Generation Process

### 1. Word Selection

Passwords are generated by selecting random words from predefined dictionaries:
- Primary dictionary: Contains longer, more diverse words
- Short dictionary: Contains shorter words for length-constrained scenarios

Each word is selected randomly using a cryptographically secure random number generator.

### 2. Word Count

Users can specify how many words to include in their password (between 1 and 10 words). The default is 3 words.

Examples:
- 3-word password: "correct-horse-battery"
- 4-word password: "correct-horse-battery-staple"

### 3. Capitalization

Words can be capitalized (first letter uppercase) for improved readability. This is enabled by default.

Examples:
- Without capitalization: "correct-horse-battery"
- With capitalization: "Correct-Horse-Battery"

### 4. Separators

Words are joined together with a customizable separator character. The default separator is a hyphen (-).

Examples with different separators:
- Hyphen: "Correct-Horse-Battery"
- Underscore: "Correct_Horse_Battery"
- Period: "Correct.Horse.Battery"
- Space: "Correct Horse Battery"
- Number: "Correct5Horse5Battery"

### 5. Length Constraints

Users can specify a minimum password length. When a length constraint is provided, Passgen will attempt to select words that meet this constraint.

The constraint must be at least 4 times the word count (assuming a minimum word length of 4 characters).

### 6. Appending Numbers

An optional random digit (0-9) can be appended to the end of the password for additional complexity.

Examples:
- Without number: "Correct-Horse-Battery"
- With number: "Correct-Horse-Battery7"

### 7. Appending Symbols

An optional random symbol can be appended to the end of the password for additional complexity. Available symbols include: !, @, #, $, %, &, *

Examples:
- Without symbol: "Correct-Horse-Battery"
- With symbol: "Correct-Horse-Battery!"

### 8. Combined Enhancements

Multiple enhancements can be combined for even stronger passwords.

Examples:
- With number and symbol: "Correct-Horse-Battery3!"
- With capitalization, number, and symbol: "Correct-Horse-Battery9#"

## Security Considerations

### Entropy

The strength of a password (measured in bits of entropy) depends on:
- Dictionary size: More words in the dictionary increase entropy
- Word count: More words increase entropy
- Enhancements: Adding numbers and symbols increases entropy

For a dictionary of 10,000 words:
- 3 words: ~39 bits of entropy
- 4 words: ~52 bits of entropy
- 5 words: ~65 bits of entropy

### Recommendations

1. **Word Count**: Use at least 3 words for basic security, 4+ words for higher security requirements
2. **Enhancements**: Enable at least one enhancement (number or symbol) for increased strength
3. **Length**: Consider using the length constraint feature for services that require minimum password lengths

### Dictionary Integrity

All word lists are verified for integrity on each application launch to ensure they haven't been tampered with.

## Best Practices

1. **Memorability**: Word-based passwords are easier to memorize than random character strings
2. **Customization**: Adjust the parameters to balance security and memorability based on your needs
3. **Unique Passwords**: Generate a new password for each account/service
4. **Storage**: Store passwords securely using a password manager
5. **Regular Updates**: Periodically update passwords, especially for sensitive accounts
