# Security Considerations and Warnings

This document outlines the security features, considerations, and warnings for the Passgen password generator application.

## Overview

Passgen is designed with security as a primary concern. The application follows industry best practices to ensure that generated passwords are strong, unpredictable, and that sensitive data is protected both at rest and in transit.

## Security Features

### 1. Cryptographically Secure Password Generation

Passgen uses Dart's `Random` class with a seed derived from the system's cryptographically secure random number generator to ensure that generated passwords are unpredictable and resistant to attacks.

### 2. Word List Integrity Verification

All word lists are verified for integrity on each application launch:
- SHA-256 checksum verification ensures word lists haven't been tampered with
- Content verification checks for duplicates, empty lines, and formatting issues
- Verification happens automatically during application initialization

### 3. Secure Storage for Settings

User preferences are stored using Flutter Secure Storage, which:
- Encrypts data at rest using platform-specific encryption mechanisms
- Provides protection against unauthorized access to settings
- Separates sensitive data from regular application data

### 4. Screen Recording Protection

In release builds, screen recording protection is enabled to prevent sensitive information from being captured during screen recording or screenshots.

### 5. Controlled Logging

Logging behavior differs between debug and release modes:
- In debug mode: Detailed logging is enabled for development and troubleshooting
- In release mode: Logging is minimized to prevent leakage of sensitive information
- Sensitive information is never logged in release builds

### 6. Debug Mode Security Checks

Certain security features can be selectively disabled in debug mode to facilitate testing, but are always enabled in release builds.

## Security Considerations

### 1. Password Strength

While Passgen generates strong passwords, users should understand:
- Password strength increases with word count and the use of enhancements (numbers, symbols)
- Generated passwords should be unique for each account/service
- Longer passwords (more words) provide exponentially better security

### 2. Clipboard Security

When passwords are copied to the clipboard:
- They remain in the clipboard until overwritten
- Users should clear their clipboard after use, especially on shared devices
- Some systems may store clipboard history, which could expose passwords

### 3. Device Security

The security of generated passwords depends on the security of the device:
- Physical access to the device could compromise password security
- Users should employ device-level security measures (PIN, password, biometrics)
- Malware on the device could potentially capture passwords

### 4. Network Security

Passgen works entirely offline and does not transmit any data over networks, eliminating risks associated with network interception or server breaches.

### 5. Memory Security

While Passgen takes steps to protect passwords:
- Passwords may temporarily exist in device memory
- Complete memory protection is difficult to achieve on all platforms
- Users should close the application when not in use

## Warnings and Limitations

### 1. Word List Limitations

- The strength of generated passwords depends on the quality and size of the word lists
- Word lists are fixed and do not update dynamically
- Compromise of word lists would affect password strength

### 2. Predictability Risks

- Using predictable parameters consistently could reduce password strength
- Users should vary their password generation parameters for different accounts
- The same seed with the same parameters will always produce the same password

### 3. Human Factors

- Generated passwords are designed to be memorable, but forgetting a password is still possible
- Writing down passwords introduces physical security risks
- Social engineering attacks could target password recall methods

### 4. Platform Limitations

- Security features depend on the underlying platform's capabilities
- Some security features may not work identically across all supported platforms
- Platform-specific vulnerabilities could affect overall security

### 5. Release vs Debug Mode Differences

- Certain security features are relaxed in debug mode for development purposes
- Release builds should always be used for production password generation
- Debug builds should never be used for generating real passwords

## Best Practices

### 1. Password Management

- Use a different password for each account/service
- Store passwords securely using a reputable password manager
- Regularly update passwords, especially for sensitive accounts

### 2. Application Usage

- Always use release builds for generating real passwords
- Close the application when not actively generating passwords
- Keep the application updated to benefit from security improvements

### 3. Device Security

- Enable device-level security features (lock screen, biometrics)
- Keep the operating system and applications updated
- Use antivirus/malware protection where appropriate

### 4. Awareness

- Be aware of shoulder surfing when using the application in public
- Clear the clipboard after copying passwords
- Report any suspected security issues to the development team

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in Passgen:
1. Do not publicly disclose the issue
2. Contact the development team through secure channels
3. Provide detailed information to help reproduce and fix the issue
4. Allow time for a fix to be developed and released before public disclosure

## Conclusion

Passgen is designed with strong security principles and implements multiple layers of protection for user data. However, security is a shared responsibility between the application developers and users. Following best practices and understanding the limitations will help ensure that passwords generated with Passgen remain secure.
